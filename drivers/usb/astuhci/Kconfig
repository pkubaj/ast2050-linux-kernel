	---help---
	  The AST Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI) is standard for 
	  USB 1.1 host controller hardware. It is an embedded HC based on AMBA bus.
	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/uhci.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called uhci-hcd.

	---help---
	  This code is new and hasn't been used with many different
	  EHCI or USB 2.0 transaction translator implementations.
	  It should work for ISO-OUT transfers, like audio.

config USB_EHCI_ROOT_HUB_TT
	bool "Root Hub Transaction Translators (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD
	---help---
	  Some EHCI chips have vendor-specific extensions to integrate
	  transaction translators, so that no OHCI or UHCI companion
	  controller is needed.  It's safe to say "y" even if your
	  controller doesn't support this feature.

	  This supports the EHCI implementation from TransDimension Inc.
